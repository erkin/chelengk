      <h3>Quick Introduction to Turkish Classical Music</h3>
      <p>
        I am, by no means, an expert on this subject. I'm doing my bachelor's
        degree on procedural generation of makam music, and as such, I'm
        recording my research here to better understand what I'm doing, and
        maybe provide an English-language resource for theoretical underpinnings
        of the makam system for people who don't speak Turkish.
      </p>
      <p>
        Traditional Turkish music is a broad field encompassing various styles,
        the most important of which are
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_classical_music">classical
        music</a> and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_folk_music">folk music</a>.
        We will be studying the classical variety, which has been significantly
        influenced by Arabic, Persian and Greek musical systems, and developed
        into a complex musical framework throughout centuries. Also, we will be
        ignoring rhythmic and vocal aspects of it for the time being, to focus
        on its instrumental elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Turkish classical music is
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterophony">heterophonic</a>
        &mdash; it features various monophonic instruments in the ensemble
        playing different variations of the same melody.
